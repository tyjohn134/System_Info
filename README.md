# System Information 

This is a toy program I wrote in C# that displays system information in a console window. This can be useful for system admin, help desk analysts, system engineers, etc. All that needs to be done is to build the project and run the exec.

## Using Visual Studio to build project:
Clone the repo and open the .sln file and build the project within Visual Studio.
